### Dice

The Mushroom Western primarily uses a d20 for gameplay, but players should also have at least one of each of the following: d4, d8, d10, and d12.

### Advantage/Disadvantage (ADV/DIS):

Certain abilities or situations may grant you a level of Advantage (ADV) or Disadvantage (DIS). You can have up to 3 levels of ADV or DIS at a time. Each ADV cancels out one DIS and vice versa. For every level of ADV you have, roll one additional die and use the highest result. For every stack of DIS you have, roll one additional die and use the lowest result.

### Attributes

Oakhearth features 4 attributes that define your character:

- Brawn: Represents physical strength and fortitude.  
- Reflex: Reflects agility, flexibility, and balance.  
- Brains: Measures knowledge and mental acuity.  
- Mettle: Captures your ability to understand and influence others.

The value of an attribute is added to relevant skills and defenses.

#### Prime Attribute:

Your Prime Attribute is your highest Attribute value.

### Luck

Luck effectively replaces HP in this game (if you see either term, assume they are interchangeable). This is done to better fit the atmosphere of the setting. It's assumed that while you still have Luck and attacks only graze you or do non-lethal damage. However, when you run out of Luck, you enter Outta Luck. 

#### Outta Luck (Death's Door)

While Outta Luck, you only have a max of 1 AP and immediately gain 1 level of Exhaustion. You return to your normal number of AP if you regain one or more Luck. 

While Outta Luck, a character is vulnerable to serious harm. Any further damage they take is deducted from their Life pool instead of Luck. A character's maximum Life is equal to their Prime Attribute score.

### Proficiency Level (PL)

Proficiency Levels represent your proficiency with a particular Skill. There are 5 Skill Proficiency Levels. You can spend Skill Points to increase your Proficiency Level in a given Skill. For every Proficiency Level you add \+2 to that skill.

### Combat Proficiency

Combat Proficiency (CP) reflects your character's skill and experience in combat, including the effective use of weapons, armor, and other tools of war.

Your Combat Proficiency (CP) is calculated as: CP \= 1 \+ ½ your character's level (rounded down)

### Rounding Rules

Always round down when calculating values, with a minimum result of 1\. The exception to this is if you have Resistance to a damage type, in this case you can round down to 0\.

### Action Points (AP)

Each player has 4 Action Points (AP) by default. This number can be temporarily increased or decreased based on circumstances. Action Points are used in combat or other time-sensitive situations. You regain all Action Points at the end of your turn. In combat, you can spend AP to give yourself ADV on an Attack check.

### Degrees of Success

When rolling a d20, add all relevant bonuses to the result. If the total exceeds the target value by 5 or more, you usually gain an additional effect. This rule is most commonly applied to Attack Rolls: for every 5 points your roll exceeds the target's defense, you deal 1 extra point of damage.

### Difficulty Challenge (DC)

The Difficulty Challenge (DC) represents how hard it is to succeed at a particular task. When attempting to overcome a challenge, your total roll (including all modifiers) must be equal to or greater than the DC to succeed.

### Multiple Check Penalty

During Combat, each time a creature makes the same Check before the end of its turn, they suffer stacking DIS on that type of Check, such as specific Flat Attribute Checks, Attack Checks, Spell Checks, and Skill Checks. This penalty only applies to Checks made during the creature’s turn, and doesn’t apply to Reactions taken on another creature’s turn (unless otherwise stated).

### Help Action outside of Combat

When outside of combat you can choose to help a creature succeed on a check if it makes sense. When you do so, the target of the Help Action adds a d8 to that check. Multiple creatures can attempt to Help a creature if it makes sense in the situation. If multiple creatures help with the check the dice size gets smaller after each creature, starting at a d8 then d6 then d4. The GM may rule that a creature must succeed on a check before they are able to help another.
