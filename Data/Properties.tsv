1	Capture	When you attack with this weapon, you instead make a Physique Check contested by the target's Physical Save. Success: The target is Grappled by the weapon until it's freed. Forced movement doesn't end the Grapple, but teleportation does. Success(10): The target is also restrained until it's freed. A creature can spend 1 AP to make a DC10 Might Check.
